# Naive Forecast Method

This Python script demonstrates the Naive Forecast Method for time series data, using a small dataset from UMICS. The Naive Method assumes that the forecast for any given period is simply the actual value from the previous period. This approach is commonly used as a baseline in time series forecasting.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Data

The script uses a small series of manually inputted data (representing actual values) to generate forecasts. Here, the `actual` values represent a series of monthly data points, which are used to generate the forecast series.

Example of actual values:
```python
actual = pd.Series([92.0, 91.7, 91.0, 89.0, 94.7, 93.5, 90.0, 89.8, 91.2, 87.2, 93.8, 98.2])
```

## Forecast Method

The Naive Forecast Method works as follows:
- The forecast for each period is simply the actual value from the previous period.
- The first period does not have a forecast, as there is no prior data point.

## Output

The script outputs a `DataFrame` that contains:
- **Actual**: The original actual data points.
- **Forecast**: The forecasted values using the Naive Method.
- **Error**: The difference between actual and forecasted values.
- **Absolute Error**: The absolute value of the error.
- **Absolute % Error**: The absolute percentage error for each forecast.

Additionally, the script calculates the **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**, which is printed alongside the DataFrame.

Example output:
```
    Actual  Forecast  Error  Absolute Error  Absolute % Error
0     92.0       NaN    NaN             NaN               NaN
1     91.7      92.0   -0.3            0.30          0.327139
...
MAPE: X.XX
```

## Running the Script

To run the script, simply execute it in your Python environment:

```bash
python naivemethod.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: A series of actual values is manually entered in the script.
2. **Forecast Generation**: The forecast values are generated by shifting the actual values by one period, using the Naive Method.
3. **Error Calculation**: The script calculates the error and absolute percentage error for each forecast.
4. **Output**: The results are printed as a DataFrame, along with the MAPE value.
